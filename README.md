As you know they are really ding dongs about computers and softwares we need you to create an app that will be the bridge between our R&D department and the end user: our sales team.

The app Will be quite simple. It only needs Two things. First. A form. The form will be for the user two complete with informations about the house. This form will be connected to the API.
